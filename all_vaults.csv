This increased activity will solidify Berachain’s position as a leading DeFi hub, encouraging further protocol development and integration.

Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
Yes, it will add additional utility for users to lock liquidity in BeraBorrow and mint NECT to further generate downstream economic benefits for the bera ecosystem

Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes, the BURR:NECT pool further helps drive volume between BurrBear’s BTC 3pool and the stablecoin 4pool (USDC:HONEY:USDT:NECT) where BURR serves as the intermediary token.

The notional TVL of hOHM on Ethereum reached ±$83M within weeks of launch (holding 28% of all staked gOHM). The reward vault would provide an incentive for current holders to put their hOHM to work on Berachain and the remaining 72% of gOHM holders to mint hOHM and bridge via Origami’s dApp (powered by LZ).

How will this contract benefit Berachain?
- Wasabee is the first meme-native DEX on Berachain, designed specifically for long-tail assets. With concentrated liquidity, dynamic fees, and automated liquidity management, we optimize trading depth and price stability—perfect for volatile meme markets. Our dynamic fee plugin is the best tracker of the volume and incentivizes the LP holders which brings fresh trading experience for users. This is infrastructure other DEXs don’t offer. Wasabee is the governance token issued by us which we will incentivize users pair the LP on this ALM vault to build both deep liquidity for bera and Wasabee. 
- The BEE–WBERA pool acts as a dual incentive engine—boosting demand for both BEE and WBERA. By anchoring $BEE to Berachain’s native asset, the pool strengthens BEE’s role as the incentive layer for meme trading while reinforcing the value of WBERA through trading volume and liquidity depth.
- Wasabee is a deeply community-driven project. Over 80% of $BEE is allocated to the community and ecosystem growth, with minimal shares for the team and marketing. We are committed to decentralization from day one—built by and for meme traders.
- Wasabee Data: Wasabee has attracted 7.33K users, facilitated 84K trades with a $17.02M total volume, reached $759.48K in TVL, and generated $63.3K in total fees to date.

The contract is divided into two stages. 
1. Users spend BERA to buy tickets, and all these BERA are sent to bribes. 
2. Users spend tickets to draw prizes from Gachapon and get various products. 
Like all blind box products, users buy additional/random items when they want to get the limited prizes.
In the process of converting BERA to BGT(PoL), the prize pool actually receives additional subsidies from BGT, so the mathematical expectation of the user's return is >1, which will drive the sales of Berachain eco-assets. We have carefully prepared a lot of special, limited gifts [confidential, which will also drive sales.
Finally, we will physically realize this capsule machine and place it at all Berachain event sites to increase the conversion rate of real users.
Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
In the offline scenario, users pay fiat to run the Gachapon, the inflow payment of fiat will be swapped into stablecoins and then converted into BERA, bringing net purchases for BERA.
Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes. The Gachapon prizes include NFTs, tokens, and merch from other Berachain ecosystem projects. We are already in talks with multiple Berachain builders to include their assets as prizes, creating direct cross-promotion and distribution opportunities. This helps bootstrap awareness and token utility for other projects, while users naturally explore the wider ecosystem.","1 At least 10,000 tickets are sold each week, resulting in an inflow of at least 69k BERA for bribes and net purchase of 69k LBGT value of prizes to contribute to the Berachain Eco products/NFTs.
2 N/A","Yes. Eden Gachapon is designed to integrate with Berachain NFTs, games, and token communities. We are actively collaborating with ecosystem partners to create exclusive prize pools that promote their protocols. Future versions may also offer liquid staking tokens or governance token rewards, helping to distribute TVL across Berachain primitives.","Yes. Eden plans to co-market Gachapon launches and prize campaigns with ecosystem projects included in the prize pools. Each collaboration will include joint X/Twitter spaces, meme contests, and booth presence at IRL events like ETHCC, DevCon, and Berachain meetups.
We’ve also secured partnerships with Web2 influencers and adult product creators who will promote Gachapon’s physical activations and link followers to on-chain experiences, driving real, sticky user acquisition.","Eden Gachapon can evolve into a core retail staking experience for Berachain — a pleasurable and playful way for new users to earn ecosystem exposure. Over time, we envision:
A rotating prize pool marketplace, where protocols can pay bribes to feature their items.


A builder-accessible interface for plugging new NFTs/tokens into Gachapon.


Regional physical Gachapon machines at global crypto events.

Stablecoin liquidity and subsequent volume is essential for future use cases to be enabled on Berachain. The previous HONEY/NECT/USDC.e pool has already facilitated more than 300M volume; we expect this number to go up with the addition of a third major stablecoin.

BurrBear’s BURR token serves as primary incentive for the growth of liquidity for USD stablecoins, then eventually base liquidity for other majors and RWA tokens (starting with Twin Finance) going live with tokenized stocks vs 3pool tokens) to give Berachain real world utility as liquidity deepens on chain and the ecosystem matures.

Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
Yes - HONEY, USDT and USDC

Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes, upcoming berachain native stablecoins intend to LP against the 4pool: : <4pool LP token> to bootstrap their own liquidity/volume and further build the 4pool (HONEY:NECT:USDC:USDT0) organically without relying on staking rewards alone.","Provide metrics or estimates on liquidity you expect to attract.
Already reached $4.5m TVL and $336M volume. Short term target: $10M TVL, $500M vol. Long term: $100M TVL, $2B vol.

Highlight any known liquidity commitments.
Aside from Boyco, various platforms are starting to integrate to “re-sell” the 3pool rewards in exchange for liquidity from their communities. TurtleDAO is the first live that has contributed ~$500k TVL with many others currently integrating.","Will this contract feed into any yield aggregators, lending markets, or liquid staking derivatives on Berachain?
Euler & ZeroLend has already integrated the previous 3pool contract as collateral. We are exploring synergies with Dolomite to further increase avenues for lending.","Are there plans to co-market with another project to bootstrap liquidity?
Yes incentives are co-provided between BurrBear and Beraborrow.","How could this reward vault evolve over time?

These products bring offchain economic value onchain, driving meaningful daily volume and user activity through speculative trading, raffles, and auctions. By deploying a $HONEY reward vault, we create a native feedback loop: as users buy and trade tokenized watches, they generate marketplace volume that earns $KVL (Kettle Volume Receipts), which can be staked to earn BGT. This ties core Berachain incentives directly to the growth of the RWA vertical—bringing a new category of liquidity, users, and narrative to Berachain.","Yes. All primary and secondary volume on the Kettle platform will route through Berachain-native assets—especially $HONEY and Berachain-aligned stablecoins. Our vault system encourages users to bridge stablecoins into Berachain, swap into supported tokens, and participate in RWA trading with onchain incentives. Additionally, we are actively designing LP pools and autocompounding mechanics for our $KVL token and eventual marketplace token, which will further deepen DEX liquidity in the Berachain ecosystem and generate sticky usage across key assets like BERA and $HONEY.

Within our first Mystery Box drop, we made our users bridge over $250k HONEY over to Berachain, making our wallet the top #30 $HONEY holders on Berachain within 12 hours.","Yes—this vault will create meaningful synergies with core Berachain protocols:

CrediFi (Lending Markets):
Kettle users who purchase or win tokenized luxury watches (e.g., Rolex, AP, Patek) can eventually borrow against the vaulted, tokenized watch NFTs through CrediFi, unlocking capital efficiency without needing to sell the underlying asset. This introduces real-world luxury goods as a new form of collateral within Berachain’s DeFi stack, expanding CrediFi’s market into high-value RWAs with verifiable, insured provenance.
Kodiak (LP Yield Aggregators):
As we roll out fungible tokens for flagship watches (e.g., $RLX for Rolex Submariners), we’ll pair them into liquidity pools on Berachain-native DEXs. These pools—such as $RLX/HONEY—will be eligible for Kodiak vaults, enabling users to autocompound trading fees and rewards. These LPs are ideal candidates for Kodiak because they’re backed by vaulted, real-world assets and expected to generate consistent trading volume due to speculative and hedging demand.","Yes—Kettle has already established proven go-to-market strategies by collaborating with top Berachain-native communities and protocols, and we have aggressive plans to scale these efforts as we bootstrap liquidity around RWAs.

Previous Co-Marketing Success
We’ve already run successful joint campaigns with the following protocols for our NFL Draft Rolex Giveaway:

Steady Teddys
Kodiak
PuffPaw
Beraland
$BITCOIN
These partnerships drove thousands of impressions, hundreds of community interactions, and direct Raffle ticket sales—demonstrating our ability to galvanize Berachain-native audiences and create hype around novel onchain experiences.

Upcoming Co-Marketing Plans
We’re in discussions to co-market future product drops and liquidity events with:

CrediFi: As we bring tokenized watches into Berachain’s lending ecosystem, we plan to co-educate and activate users on the collateral potential of RWAs through joint threads, tutorials, and incentive programs.
Kodiak: Once fungible RWA tokens (e.g., $RLX) are live and paired into LPs, we’ll run campaigns showcasing how to farm yields via Kodiak vaults using real-world-backed assets—positioning Kettle as the best entry point to Berachain’s DeFi stack.
These marketing activations will coincide with product releases (e.g., new vaults, raffles, LP rewards) and include cross-posting, influencer amplification, co-hosted spaces, and whitelist collabs to drive liquidity and user growth across the entire Berachain ecosystem.","This reward vault is the first step toward establishing RWAs as a core pillar of Berachain’s long-term ecosystem narrative and liquidity structure. While it initially incentivizes trading activity around Kettle’s Mystery Boxes and tokenized luxury watches, its evolution will follow several key phases:

From Marketplace Incentives to RWA Asset Pools
Kettle will introduce fungible RWA tokens (e.g., $RLX for Rolex Submariners), each backed 1:1 by vaulted, insured physical assets. These tokens will trade against $HONEY, $BERA, and native stables—forming high-volume, high-trust asset pairs on Berachain DEXs.
Core Liquidity Pairs for BEX and Kodiak
Flagship RWA pairs like $RLX/HONEY can become core pools on BEX and be supported by Kodiak vaults for autocompounding yield.
Stable, Yield-Bearing Vaults
Kettle will explore RealYield Vaults offering yield from secondary market fees and redemptions, providing stable-value exposure backed by appreciating assets.

Shifting to Fee-Centric Rewards: This model directly incentivizes economic activity (trading) rather than passive capital accumulation. By rewarding users based on the fees they generate, it encourages more frequent and potentially larger volume trades, leading to a more vibrant and active on-chain economy.
Sustainable Incentive Model: Tying rewards directly to fee generation creates a more sustainable loop. As trading volume and fee income increase, the ability to reward traders also increases, potentially reducing reliance on inflationary BGT emissions solely for TVL acquisition, where APYs can be unstable and bribes costly relative to returns.
Addressing current PoL Limitations: The contract offers a solution for users whose capital (like V3 Style LP NFTs) does not directly fit into existing PoL incentive structures. So it largely extends what PoL can do
Create the Healthy Dual Flywheel Cycle: our All-in-one vault creates a synergistic relationship between traders and LPs. As traders experience the benefits of fee rebates and observe the enhanced APYs on the LP side (driven by their own increased activity), a portion may be incentivized to also become LPs. Conversely, traditional LPs, witnessing the tangible benefits (LBGT) awarded to active traders, might be encouraged to engage in more trading themselves. This creates a powerful dual flywheel, amplifying both trading volume and liquidity depth.
Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
BERA,  HONEY, and core stable assets(i.e MEAT, NECT), as well as HOT MEME tokens.
Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes, this contract will ensure deep, capital-efficient liquidity for all major assets on Berachain (BERA, WETH, WBTC) at the underlayer.
This contract will also incentivize the long-tail assets to deploy liquidity on the blockchain (i.e meme token)as it reduces friction for new pairs. New projects launching tokens on Berachain could see quicker bootstrapping of trading activity, as traders are immediately eligible for fee-based rewards 
All pools underlying this vault are already integrated with Aquabera (ALM) / BeraTrax (Yield Aggregator) / HPOT (launchpad) / Holdstation (Aggregator) /...","Provide metrics or estimates on liquidity you expect to attract.
The All-In-One Vault is not launching from a zero base; we have an immediate pathway to demonstrate its efficacy and attract substantial liquidity.
Initial Seed Liquidity & Enhanced Incentives: We currently manage three Berachain-approved Reward Vaults (RVs) with a combined TVL of approximately $900,000. This existing TVL can be seamlessly migrated into the All-In-One Vault. This migration will offer users from these established vaults a more consistent, dynamic, and potentially more lucrative incentivization model, as rewards will be directly tied to their value-generating activities (trading fees) rather than solely static TVL contributions or fluctuating bribe-dependent APYs.
Stimulating Trading Activity & Organic LP Growth: The core premise is that traders, including those from the initially migrated RVs, will be significantly motivated by the prospect of having a substantial portion of their trading fees rebated as valuable BGT rewards. This direct incentive is expected to foster more active and higher-volume trading within these initial pools. The resultant increase in trading volume will naturally generate higher APYs for Liquidity Providers (LPs) in those pairs, making them more attractive and drawing in further LP capital. This mechanism inherently promotes a healthy TVL-to-fee ratio, contributing to a genuinely sustainable liquidity ecosystem.
The Dual Flywheel Effect: We anticipate a synergistic relationship between traders and LPs. As traders experience the benefits of fee rebates and observe the enhanced APYs on the LP side (driven by their own increased activity), a portion may be incentivized to also become LPs. Conversely, traditional LPs, witnessing the tangible benefits awarded to active traders, might be encouraged to engage in more trading themselves. This creates a powerful dual flywheel, amplifying both trading volume and liquidity depth.
Short-Term Growth Projection: For the initial three pools to be migrated, we conservatively estimate that the enhanced, fee-driven incentive structure could lead to a threefold increase in their collective liquidity in the short term as these flywheels begin to turn.
Long-Term Growth Projection: We believe our attractive All-In-One Vault can at least attract $80 million in liquidity to pools participating in this fee-centric reward mechanism. This target is supported by promising initial conversations with several institutional investors. These entities have expressed significant interest in the All-In-One Vault model, viewing it as an innovative and potentially more capital-efficient mechanism to deploy their liquidity and earn returns based on real economic activity. Their potential participation underscores the viability and attractiveness of this approach for sophisticated market participants.
A Paradigm Shift in Reward Distribution: By successfully scaling this model, we aim to demonstrate a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional liquidity mining programs, positioning Berachain as a leader in innovative DeFi incentive structures.","Yes, all underlying LPs will be integrated into the following:
Integrated with Rootsfi as collateral
Integrated with Infrared.
Integrated into Beefy, the dynamic vault.
Integrated into Beratrax, the yield aggregator.","Our incentive for trading pairs will create higher APR for all trading pairs farmed on Wasabee DEX. We have held many such joint events with Wasabee and some wallet projects, such as Bitget Wallet. This All-in-one aims to expand such incentives into long-term and sustainable incentives. We will jointly expand our influence on the MEME Campaign.","Our All-in-One reward vault could serve as a fundamental piece of Berachain's DeFi infrastructure. As it drives fairly distributed BGT rewards in a way that directly fuels on-chain economic activity.
Our vision is to create a robust, rewarding layer for good trading activity that generates more fees, which in turn fund more rewards for traders, creating a positive feedback loop. This could lead to deeper, more resilient liquidity across the ecosystem because LPs would benefit from consistently higher fees and naturally build a higher APY.
Over time, the weights assigned to different receipt tokens (representing different fee sources or token pairs) are dynamically adjusted through the community governance, allowing the Berachain community to fine-tune incentives towards specific strategic goals (e.g., promoting trading in under-served pairs or prioritizing certain types of fee generation).",https://twitter.com/honeypotfinance/status/1927826886404542813,https://hub.forum.berachain.com/t/reward-vault-request-for-honeypot-all-in-one-vault/1206,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,completed,2025-05-28 22:10:56,,2025-05-28 22:24:25,c1f09108fe,,We will get back to you soon

How will this contract benefit Berachain?
This contract will help bootstrap real-world asset (RWA) volume on Berachain by incentivizing users to participate in Kettle’s onchain marketplace—beginning with our high-end Mystery Box drops of tokenized luxury watches. These products bring offchain economic value onchain, driving meaningful daily volume and user activity through speculative trading, raffles, and auctions. By deploying a $HONEY reward vault, we create a native feedback loop: as users buy and trade tokenized watches, they generate marketplace volume that earns $KVR (Kettle Volume Receipts), which can be staked to earn BGT. This ties core Berachain incentives directly to the growth of the RWA vertical—bringing a new category of liquidity, users, and narrative to Berachain. 
2. Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
Yes. All primary and secondary volume on the Kettle platform will route through Berachain-native assets—especially $HONEY and Berachain-aligned stablecoins. Our vault system encourages users to bridge stablecoins into Berachain, swap into supported tokens, and participate in RWA trading with onchain incentives. Additionally, we are actively designing LP pools and autocompounding mechanics for our $KVR token and eventual marketplace token, which will further deepen DEX liquidity in the Berachain ecosystem and generate sticky usage across key assets like BERA and $HONEY. 
3. Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Absolutely. Our marketplace and rewards architecture will natively integrate with key Berachain protocols including:
* CrediFi to support future RWA-based lending markets.
* Berachain DEX routing for token swaps tied to RWA trades.
* Native NFTs and governance for verified watch ownership and curated collections. 
This contract serves as a launchpad for a wide array of RWA-native trading pairs on Berachain, all of which drive adoption and bridge physical assets to crypto-native incentives. As trading volume scales, so will demand for core Berachain assets and DeFi primitives.","This initial Mystery Box campaign will bring $250,000 of volume from the initial sellout alone. Future Mystery Box mints plus secondary market action will bring millions of dollars of volume.

We are bridging over an additional $250k worth of RWA luxury watch NFTs over to Berachain from other chains.","Yes—this vault will create meaningful synergies with core Berachain protocols by driving liquidity and user activity into adjacent primitives that enhance the RWA trading ecosystem:

CrediFi (Lending Markets)
Kettle users who purchase or win tokenized luxury watches (e.g., Rolex, AP, Patek) can eventually borrow against the vaulted, tokenized watch NFTs through CrediFi, unlocking capital efficiency without needing to sell the underlying asset. This introduces real-world luxury goods as a new form of collateral within Berachain’s DeFi stack, expanding CrediFi’s market into high-value RWAs with verifiable, insured provenance.

Kodiak (LP Yield Aggregators)
As we roll out fungible tokens for flagship watches (e.g., $RLX for Rolex Submariners), we’ll pair them into liquidity pools on Berachain-native DEXs. These pools—such as $RLX/HONEY—will be eligible for Kodiak vaults, enabling users to autocompound trading fees and rewards. These LPs are ideal candidates for Kodiak because they’re backed by vaulted, real-world assets and expected to generate consistent trading volume due to speculative and hedging demand.","Yes—Kettle has already established proven go-to-market strategies by collaborating with top Berachain-native communities and protocols, and we have aggressive plans to scale these efforts as we bootstrap liquidity around RWAs.
Previous Co-Marketing Success
We’ve already run successful joint campaigns with the following protocols for our NFL Draft Rolex Giveaway:
* Steady Teddys
* Kodiak
* PuffPaw
* Beraland
* $BITCOIN
These partnerships drove thousands of impressions, hundreds of community interactions, and direct Raffle ticket sales—demonstrating our ability to galvanize Berachain-native audiences and create hype around novel onchain experiences. 
Upcoming Co-Marketing Plans
We’re in discussions to co-market future product drops and liquidity events with:
* CrediFi As we bring tokenized watches into Berachain's lending ecosystem, we plan to co-educate and activate users on the collateral potential of RWAs through joint threads, tutorials, and incentive programs.
* Kodiak Once fungible RWA tokens (e.g., $RLX) are live and paired into LPs, we’ll run campaigns showcasing how to farm yields via Kodiak vaults using real-world-backed assets—positioning Kettle as the best entry point to Berachain’s DeFi stack.
These marketing activations will coincide with product releases (e.g., new vaults, raffles, LP rewards) and include cross-posting, influencer amplification, co-hosted spaces, and whitelist collabs to drive liquidity and user growth across the entire Berachain ecosystem.","This reward vault is the first step toward establishing RWAs as a core pillar of Berachain’s long-term ecosystem narrative and liquidity structure. While it initially incentivizes trading activity around Kettle’s Mystery Boxes and tokenized luxury watches, its evolution will follow several key phases:

1. From Marketplace Incentives to RWA Asset Pools
As Kettle expands its catalog of tokenized assets (e.g., Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe), we will introduce fungible RWA tokens (e.g., $RLX for Rolex Submariners), each backed 1:1 by vaulted, insured physical assets. These tokens will trade against $HONEY, $BERA, and Berachain-native stablecoins—gradually forming high-volume, high-trust asset pairs on Berachain DEXs like BEX.

2. Core Liquidity Pairs for BEX and Kodiak
With enough traction and volume, flagship pairs such as $RLX/HONEY, and eventually even RWA Index Tokens could become core pools on BEX, supported by Kodiak vaults for autocompounding yield. These pools would represent real-world value onchain, attracting users seeking exposure to luxury assets, yield, and price appreciation—all in a fully composable, DeFi-native format.

3. Foundation for Stable, Yield-Bearing Vaults
Longer term, Kettle will explore packaging tokenized luxury goods into RealYield Vaults that generate sustainable yield through secondary market fees, redemptions, and staking participation. These vaults could eventually serve as alternatives or complements to traditional stable pools, offering stable-value, low-volatility exposure backed by scarce, appreciating assets.

4. Institutional and Retail Onboarding Layer
By creating an approachable, reward-driven RWA layer on Berachain, this vault lays the groundwork for onboarding collectors, traders, and institutions who traditionally operate outside of DeFi. Our strategy brings fresh capital, higher-value assets, and compelling narratives (like tokenized Rolex trading against $HONEY) directly into Berachain’s native economy.

In short, this reward vault evolves from a tactical incentive engine into the backbone of Berachain’s RWA liquidity layer, creating sticky TVL, DeFi integration, and lasting ecosystem value.",https://x.com/kettle_shop/status/1927197122870276102,https://hub.forum.berachain.com/t/reward-vault-request-for-kettle-volume-token/1199,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,completed,2025-05-26 18:02:49,,2025-05-27 02:58:27,2994eff237,,We will get back to you soon

BGT (and thus BERA sink). $LBGT used for buybacks will be locked forever on the pool causing a slowdown on the chain inflation through BGT redeems.

Constant incentives. This increases competition on the incentives market while also increasing the BGT yield.

Proof of Liquidity innovation. QIA showcases a novel way to work with Proof Liquidity, serving as a model and inspiration for future projects that want to use the chain in non-ortodox ways.

Gathering Users. We want to use QIA as a gateway for memetoken traders to come to Berachain, increasing the user base and Proof of Liquidity awareness.

Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?

Not initially, but can increase $LBGT depth with new pools being spun in the future. And enable interesting integrations notably with Osito.

Stablecoin liquidity and subsequent volume is essential for future use cases to be enabled on Berachain. The previous HONEY/NECT/USDC.e pool has already facilitated more than 300M volume; we expect this number to go up with the addition of a third major stablecoin.

BurrBear’s BURR token serves as primary incentive for the growth of liquidity for USD stablecoins, then eventually base liquidity for other majors and RWA tokens (starting with twinfinance.io/ going live with tokenized stocks vs 3pool tokens) to give Berachain real world utility as liquidity deepens on chain and the ecosystem matures.

Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
Yes - HONEY, USDT and USDC

Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes, upcoming berachain native stablecoins intend to LP against the 4pool: : <4pool LP token> to bootstrap their own liquidity/volume and further build the 4pool (HONEY:NECT:USDC:USDT0) organically without relying on staking rewards alone.","Provide metrics or estimates on liquidity you expect to attract.

Enabling BGT emissions to this pool will provide another target for holders to LP, continuing the growth of demand for gBERA (LST), acting as a further token sink for BERA itself.

Will it deepen liquidity for a major ecosystem token (e.g., BERA, core stable asset)?
Yes - it builds another layer of DeFi utility and liquidity sink on top of BERA by encouraging gBERA usage.

Does it enable important trading pairs that drive adoption or integrate with other Berachain projects?
Yes, this pool deepens the partnership between Smilee Finance, an important LST in Berachain, and BurrBear.","Provide metrics or estimates on liquidity you expect to attract.
$23,000 in liquidity already seeded, with more to come from the community once pool is announced.

Highlight any known liquidity commitments.
BurrBear has already seeded this pool directly with Smilee Finance, and both projects will be consistently deploying more liquidity on Berachain. Community LPs will follow as emissions activate + once we start pairing BURR against various stable pairs for arbitrage liquidity.","Will this contract feed into any yield aggregators, lending markets, or liquid staking derivatives on Berachain?
Yes, wgBERA itself is a liquid staking derivative of BERA.","Are there plans to co-market with another project to bootstrap liquidity?
Yes. In addition to the obvious collaboration with Smilee Finance, more assets will be paired with BURR in collaboration with asset issuers. 

As mentioned in a previous proposal here (https://hub.forum.berachain.com/t/general-non-bex-rfrv-reward-vault-request-for-burr-wbera-generalized-pool/853), the main goal is to use BURR as arbitrage liquidity between stablecoin pairs and BERA/BGT LSTs to increase volume by pairing stable assets against volatile assets. 

The wgBERA/BURR pool represents the next step in the bootstrapping on low TVL, exotic assets.","This reward vault will serve to grow liquidity for wgBERA and BURR, allowing BURR to serve as an arbitrage token between wBERA, wgBERA and eventually other major LSTs as highlighted before.",https://x.com/babbysfirstNFT/status/1913861140070682956,https://hub.forum.berachain.com/t/general-non-bex-rfrv-reward-vault-request-for-burr-wgbera-generalized-pool/1002,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,completed,2025-04-24 10:13:42,,2025-04-24 10:47:07,aff6810071,,We will get back to you soon

Importantly, Bedrock will prioritize higher incentives to the uniBTC/WBTC pool over the brBTC/uniBTC pool through PoL to deepen WBTC liquidity on Berachain. This ensures that WBTC benefits the most from this integration.
Overall, this contract grows TVL, enhances BTC utility, strengthens core trading infrastructure, and positions Berachain as a leading BTC DeFi hub.


2. Yes—this contract will significantly deepen liquidity for WBTC, which is a major ecosystem token.

Already approved for emode, rUSD will be used for automated looping of srUSD, providing sustainable stablecoin yields within the Berachain ecosystem. Users can also borrow rUSD against many other assets on Dolomite. drUSD will be a key pillar of a robust stablecoin lending market.","At launch as an example, $100m deposited into drUSD (this would be a minimum $10m principal rUSD into the protocol at 10x looped; if people use less leverage, the principal will rise) and with the current Reservoir balance sheet yielding 6% apy - this would equate to $600k in annualized profit margin for the protocol. Reservoir intends to use 25% of this profit, $150k annualized, $12.5k per month to incentivize the reward vault.

Additionally, Dolomite is contributing incentives to the vault - 30% of the fees from lending for drUSD. For example, $10m deposited ($100m in drUSD, so $90m lent), at a ~90% utilization, 16% apr, at 30% of fees equates to $4.32m, annualized, $360k per month.

Bringing this together results in $372,500 of BERA being purchased each month to use toward incentivization. We intend to grow and scale this market as much as possible and this will create more buying demand for BERA.

The other net positive through this profitability, is that Reservoir can keep the srUSD apy rate (the yield bearing stablecoin) at the highest yielding level on Berachain creating more TVL growth and increase lending and borrowing in both Dolomite and Euler.

The interest rate for borrowing rUSD vs. supplying srUSD is purposefully set higher to encourage people to loop other stables into srUSD — so there are implicit second-order effects of this loop that will drive risk-off stablecoin loopers into the Berachain ecosystem. Looping those “other stables into srUSD” will likely result in more net buying of BERA as Dolomite creates reward vaults for assets like HONEY and redirects fees into buy pressure.","Yes, directly with Dolomite.",Yes - Dolomite and Infrared,"'- Major source of leverage for berachain assets and consistent source of yield.
- Eventually drUSD deposited in PoL will be a collateral asset to borrow against

The goal of this reward vault is to contribute to the growth of the Berachain ecosystem. In order to ensure this goal is met, below are a few notes to ensure the implementation of the vault aligns with Governance.

To kickstart this flywheel of borrowing, much of the early activity will be synthetic. The maximum leverage on this loop will be capped at 10x. Once there is a healthy amount of borrowing demand for rUSD, this loop will transition to include using Honey as a borrowing asset for polrUSD.

The reserve factor will be set at 50% for rUSD, 50% for Honey.

Reservoir and Dolomite will bribe the rUSD token deposits into Dolomite in order to encourage deposits.

The new deposits will kick off a flywheel for using drUSD as a collateral asset, and also raise rates for srUSD to encourage more looping using Honey, USDC and other stables.

Borrowing against drUSD deposited into proof of liquidity (polrUSD) in emode will only be available in rUSD and Honey. This will establish Honey as the premier lending asset for PoL assets, while also safeguarding other major stables from excessive rates.

In the long run, this flywheel establishes significant demand for Honey generating a positive outcome for the DeFi markets on Berachain and the ecosystem as a whole.",https://x.com/reservoir_xyz/status/1907047462168375746,https://hub.forum.berachain.com/t/general-non-bex-rfrv-reward-vault-request-for-drusd/782/1,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,completed,2025-04-17 18:32:59,,2025-04-17 18:57:22,d4694b1f09,,We will get back to you soon

GRQ is a parody-powered financial experiment designed for degens, dreamers, and anyone who's ever ignored a ""DYOR"" warning. 
But behind the meme-friendly exterior lies innovative tokenomics built to reward loyalty and create sustainable value.

Innovative Mechanics
As an advanced Tomb Finance fork, GRQ introduces several key innovations to the algorithmic stablecoin model:

Native Token Fee Mechanism: When users claim protocol rewards, they pay fees in berachain's native token, creating a consistent flow of ecosystem value

Proof of Liquidity Integration: These fees directly incentivize our berachain PoL reward vaults, connecting our protocol to the broader ecosystem governance

Loyalty-Rewarding Design: Our unique mechanics reward long-term stakers while implementing measured disincentives for short-term speculation

Sustainable Flywheel
The GRQ tokenomic design creates a self-reinforcing system where:

Protocol rewards generate native token fees -> These fees power PoL reward vaults -> PoL vaults produce additional yields for loyal stakers -> Increased yields attract more deposits and protocol activity -> More protocol activity generates more fees

This elegant flywheel transforms short-term speculation into long-term value accrual, aligning incentives across all participants in the GRQ ecosystem.",https://www.grq.institute/genesis,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grq-institute/static/refs/heads/main/Logo%20-%20Black%20Background.png,GRQ-WBERA on grq.institute,0xa7782ff04dE0E7F7084EedB364F485efeD3fcc49,https://github.com/grq-institute/static/blob/main/Icon_GRQ_Vault.png?raw=true,0x68Cac522833F38E088EEC5e356956C02F0268063,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WY2mfvsc6nnIGPVVTp-kR2fr4VTHzL41b7tnpWK_vJA/edit?usp=sharing,non-BEX,Kodiak,https://berascan.com/address/0x68cac522833f38e088eec5e356956c02f0268063,"Genesis Contract: https://docs.grq.institute/security/audits

 - project treasury 
 - protocol fee recycling (dynamic)
-> Depends on the project’s success but can create a flywheel.
-> Estimate: Initial injection of 10k USD worth of WBERA, then weekly mid 4-figures",min 1 year,"The incentive allocation from our protocol fees will be fully automated and on-chain (Fee collector distributes the incentives to the RewardVault).
Our governance will kick in once our share token is live (The weekend of April 18 ‘25).

Our protocol's integration with PoL reward vaults creates a mutually beneficial relationship with the Berachain ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

Fee Recycling: Our innovative claim fee structure captures WBERA from users and directs it directly into PoL vaults, creating a continuous flow of native token incentives without requiring additional emissions from the protocol treasury.

PoL Participation Expansion: By seamlessly onboarding new users to berachain's PoL system, we introduce new participants who might otherwise not engage directly with governance or liquidity provision. This broadens the base of active ecosystem participants.

Sustainable Liquidity Model: Unlike temporary incentive programs, our protocol creates persistent economic incentives for maintaining deep liquidity pools, supporting berachain's broader goal of sustainable market depth and stability.

Governance Engagement: The dual-reward mechanism naturally funnels our community into the berachain governance ecosystem as they begin accumulating BGT, increasing the diversity and robustness of governance participation.
Educational Pipeline: For many of our users, this will represent their first interaction with a PoL mechanism, serving as an educational onramp to berachain's innovative consensus model.

2.
Yes, our protocol directly deepens WBERA liquidity through multiple mechanisms:

WBERA Pair Concentration: Our primary liquidity pools pair with WBERA, creating significant and concentrated liquidity for the native ecosystem token.

Fee-Driven Accumulation: Our protocol will accumulate substantial WBERA through our claim fee mechanism and redirects these assets to further incentivize liquidity depth rather than converting to other assets.

Compounding Incentives: The dual-reward structure (protocol rewards + BGT) creates compounding incentives for WBERA liquidity providers, making our pools increasingly attractive as the protocol scales.

Based on our current growth trajectory, we project contributing meaningful liquidity to WBERA pairs, supporting price stability and reducing slippage for all ecosystem participants.

3.
Not yet, potentially in the future.","1. Right now ~250k but we intend to multiply this once the stage1 of our protocol is live (Easter weekend).

2. No formal commitments, but liquidity is an important aspect to actively participate in our protocol.",We are in talks with Infrared right now but nothing fix.,We have a decent network inside berachain ecosystem and a few partnerships in place.,"As the first tomb fork on berachain, our initial focus is strategic user acquisition. We aim to attract over 1,000 experienced DeFi users from other chains, effectively igniting a degen season on berachain.
